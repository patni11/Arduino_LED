# Arduino_LED
This is a simple project I create to teach other how to connect arduino to a smartphone using wifi and send data through web sockets. This project also has Fast LED implementation to send the data about lights from phone to arduino. You can make all sorts of project from it by altering the code

Based on code written by rekomerio. https://github.com/rekomerio
